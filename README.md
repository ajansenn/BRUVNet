# BRUVNet (Baited Remote Underwater Video Net)

BRUVNett is a platform which hosts and shares labelled images of fish used for computer vision and deep learning.   

It aims to consolidate labelled fish datasets into one gold standard, with associated metadata, allowing users to subset and query easily. This will enable scientists, environmental managers and academics to research and develop their own custom models for fish species identification.

Associated with BRUVNet is the workflow which enables the distribution of images for labelling to the masses in a controlled and secured manner using VoTT. 

This work is supported by The Supervising Scientist Branch and Microsoft. All content and code is open sourced and made publically available. 

BRUVNet holds image labelling challenges which calls on Citizen Scientists of the world to help build our dataset! If you'd like to contribute, follow the link here to the BRUVNet website, or contact andrew.jansen@awe.gov.au to access your discrete set of images to label!
